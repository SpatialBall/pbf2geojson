This is a yet another convertor of OpenStreetMap pbf files. This time it converts to geojson.

It keeps the intermediate results in memory (I am using Trove Collections) that means good speed (faster then ogr2ogr), but lot's of memory consumption.

This utility was created for my pet project Walks.IO and is a good excuse to try out Java 8 streams and lambdas.
